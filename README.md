## Ansible playbooks

### A collection of repetitive jobs written into ansible playbooks by Thanh Loyal

If you are like me, who usually find him self doing an installation again and again, you may (or may not) 
find this collection useful. I have written all steps to, for e.g, installing nginx on RHEL/CentoS/RockyLinux
and also having modsecurity module compiled into it to protect webapps.

I am happy to share them here, if you are looking for something similar, hope that this repository will save you some time.
